    <p>Aloha <script src="js/app.js"></script>!</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph about me. I like to code. I started my coding journey when I started building websites with Wordpress, and began teaching block coding to elementary students as a STEM teacher. </p>
    <p>I have enjoyed working with software engineers and designers through my entrepreneurial career. In the last year, I have lead a small team through the process of building an application. We finished the app, the business succeeded in some ways, and I learned a lot, but I never really learned the fundamentals of software development and computer science. I want to develop my skills in problem-solving with a team through the use of code so that I can get a job, and have a more stable life outside of entrepreneurial endeavors.</p>
